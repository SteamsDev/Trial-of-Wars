# Trial-of-Wars
From myself and some helpful members of the OpenRA community comes the first complete singleplayer campaign for the OpenRA mod Cameo, dubbed "Trial of Wars."

# Current Mission List

- Mission 1: First Down

"This is the higher command. We've gotten word that all of the teams' Command Centers have landed and are fully operational. You will be in charge of the Vulture team. Explore the area and report anything you can back to me. We need to figure out where we are on this planet, who we're dealing with, and who sent out the distress signal that brought us here. Good luck!"

- Mission 2: The Calling

"We received a transmission from one of the armies on this planet, the "Orange Star." It was them who sent the signal and called us to this planet. They have informed us that this planet is suffering from siesmis activity and won't remain stable for too long. We'll need to negotiate possible fixes and agreements with them, but the area is currently under threat. Take control of our base and defend the Command Center while we make the negotiations. Then, as the Orange Star leader leaves the area, escort him out of harm's way."

- Mission 3: Data Mine

"The Orange Star have agreed to help us stabilize the planet. To do so, we will build three large Stabilizer devices that will bring stability to the most dangerous spots on the planet. The construction of each of these devices is underway, but to complete them, we need technology from two more of the so-called "armies" on the planet. Commander, I know I'm asking the ridiculous, but you will need to sieze property from these two armies and gather technology from them. We have given you authorization to use brute force in this battle. Capture and defend each of the sides' factories and keep them intact long enough for us to extract the technology we need."

- Mission 4: Superiors

"With the construction of each of the Stabilizer devices nearing completion, some of the planet's commanding officers have not been keen on seeing the devices to said completion. The Yellow Comet army has deployed two bases near the first Stabilizer device. these are clearly a threat and should be eliminated. We will leave you to it, Commander. Take control and send the Yellow Comet packing."

- Mission 5: Approaching Darkness

"The first Stablizer device is now safe, but the second device is still under threat from both the "Green Earth" and another unknown army. It seems there is still work to do. Defend the stablizer and drive out the enemy forces."

- Mission 6: Calamity

"Our fears were not without merit - the "Black Hole" army has just launched an assault on the third and final Stabilizer device, but it gets worse. They have seized one of our bases and has begun to combine their technology with ours. Commander, we cannot let this project fail. Hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive, then push back the Black Hole resistance."

- Mission 7: Rule One

"With all three Stabilizers online, the seismic activiy on this planet has begun to decrease, allowing us to deal with the Black Hole threat more easily. To start off, we need to teach them a little something about stealing and dispose of the Terran base they captured. Don't worry about capturing it - we can send more forces later if need be. If you want to capture it, though, you may. Either way, your mission is still the same: Drive out the Black Hole and make sure they never touch our technology again."
